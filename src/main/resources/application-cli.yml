# Profile for CLI one-shot mode - minimal logging, clean JSON output.
#
# Like STDIO mode, we cannot disable the web context in native images
# (AOT-compiled web beans would crash). The embedded server starts on
# an ephemeral port and is harmless since the process exits immediately
# after the command completes.
spring:
  main:
    banner-mode: off

server:
  port: 0   # random ephemeral port -- avoids conflicts with running servers

# Suppress all log output except errors.
# Uses Spring Boot's built-in logging properties (no custom logback XML)
# to avoid GraalVM native-image reflection issues.
